# **üß† Supported Benchmarks**

# **üß† Supported Benchmarks**

Each folder in the repository corresponds to a specific Human Benchmark challenge, containing one main Python script to run the automation.

**Note:**

- The **chimp script** is not very reliable and does not consistently produce accurate results.
- Scripts that require taking screenshots need you to manually enter the dimensions of your player/window inside the code for them to work correctly.

# **‚öôÔ∏è Requirements**

Most scripts use libraries such as:

- `pyautogui`
- `mss`
- `pillow`
- `numpy`
- `keyboard`
- `opencv-python`
- `pytesseract` (for OCR-based automation)

Install all dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
